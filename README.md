# Details About The Dataset



# Data Cleaning & Preparation

## Data Cleaning:

1  Check for duplicate values- No duplicates found

2  Blank and formatting- No blank values found and formatting is fine.

## Preparation:

1 Age is in numbers which is of little or no use. So, i created column called age groups and group the age into 3 main groups naming: Young, Middle and old aged.

2 Change wordings in sex column from M to Male and F to Female for better readability.

3 Change wordings in ‘Chest Pain Type’ Column column from TA to Typical Anginal Pain, ATA to Atypical Anginal Pain, NAP to Non-Anginal Pain and ASY to Asymptomatic Pain for better readability.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:

For analysis I will use **tableau** for creating charts to finding insights.

First I imported the data to tableau.

1. Then I created an area chart that shows number of people suffering from heart disease filtered by age group and gender.

2. Created a bar chart which shows median cholesterol levels by gender and age groups.

3. Created a stacked column chart that shows number of people experienced different types of chest pain filtered by whether they have heart disease or not.

4. Created a pie chart to show composition of people out of total experienced chest pain filtered by age group and gender.

5. To check if there is a correlation between age and Resting BP I created a scatterplot filtered by gender and heart disease.

6. To see how many people out of total have ECG results normal, LVH, ST, I created a pie chart

7. Created a scatter plot to show correlation between age and max HR.

8. Finally I created a bubble chart to find any relation between age and old peak.
