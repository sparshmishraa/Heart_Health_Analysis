# Details About The Dataset



# Data Cleaning & Preparation

## Data Cleaning:

1  Check for duplicate values- No duplicates found

2  Blank and formatting- No blank values found and formatting is fine.

## Preparation:

1 Age is in numbers which is of little or no use. So, i created column called age groups and group the age into 3 main groups naming: Young, Middle and old aged.

2 Change wordings in sex column from M to Male and F to Female for better readability.

3 Change wordings in ‘Chest Pain Type’ Column column from TA to Typical Anginal Pain, ATA to Atypical Anginal Pain, NAP to Non-Anginal Pain and ASY to Asymptomatic Pain for better readability.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:

For analysis I will use **Tableau** for creating charts to finding insights.

First I imported the data to tableau.

1. Then I created an bar chart that shows number of people suffering from heart disease by age-group.

2. Created a bar chart which shows median cholesterol levels by gender and age groups.

4. Created a pie chart to show composition of people out of total experienced chest pain filtered by age group and gender.

5. To check if there is a correlation between age and Resting BP I created a scatterplot filtered by gender and heart disease.


# Key Insights

1. **Age and Heart Disease Prevalence**: A significant 85.6% of heart disease cases are found in the elderly, while 13.3% are in the middle-aged group, and only 1% affect young individuals.

2. **Cholesterol Levels by Gender**: Half of all females have cholesterol levels exceeding 267 mg/dL, while 50% of males have levels over 239 mg/dL.

3. **Pain Type Distribution**: Asymptomatic cases dominate, with 54.3% of patients reporting no pain, followed by 25% experiencing non-anginal pain, 12.2% with atypical anginal pain, and the rest showing typical anginal pain.

4. **Age and Blood Pressure**: There is a positive correlation between age and resting blood pressure, indicating that older patients tend to have higher BP levels.
